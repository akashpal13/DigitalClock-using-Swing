# Digital Clock with Java Swing

This project implements a digital clock using Java Swing. It explores different ways of updating the clock, including using `Timer` and a separate `Thread`. The digital clock continuously displays the current time in the format `hh:mm:ss`.

## Features

- **Swing GUI:** Utilizes Java Swing for building the graphical user interface.
- **Multithreading:** Implements a separate thread for continuous clock updates.
- **Time Format:** Displays time in the format `hh:mm:ss`.
- **Customization:** The code can be easily extended for customization and additional features.

## Usage

To run the digital clock, simply compile and execute the `Main` class.

```bash
javac Main.java
java Main
